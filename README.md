# **Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction ‚úà**

## Project Idea üîé
----

Project for building machine learning model for predicting satisfaction for airline passangers based on thier flight survey. I'm applying some of data analysis and data visualization techniques in the data for understanding the domain more and more . After data understanding then perform some of data preprocessing before modelling and bulding machine learning model to estimate if passenger is satisfacted or not ? .


## About Dataset ‚ñ∂
----

This dataset contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey. What factors are highly correlated to a satisfied (or dissatisfied) passenger? Can you predict passenger satisfaction?

Dataset is splited two csv files (train.csv - test.csv). one for training contain 80% of whole data and one for testing contain 20% of whole data

## Final Conclusions ‚ù§
----

*  56.5% of Passengers are Dissatified or Neatural and 43.5 of Passengers are Statified

*  57.11% of Female Passengers are Dissatified or Neatural 

* 55.97% of Male Passengers are Dissatified or Neatural 

*  Most of Neutral or Dissatisfied  Passenger give Cleanliness  rating of Good(3) and Very Good(4)

* Most of  Satisfied Passenger give Cleanliness rating of Excellent(5) and Very Good(4)

* 69.45% of Bussiness Class  Passengers are Satisfied 

* 18.76% of Economy Class Passengers are Satisfied

* 24.63% of Economy Plus Class Passengers are Satisfied

* Age Average  of Satisfied Passengers is close to 42 year

* Age Average  of Neutral or Dissatisfied Passengers is close to 38 year 

*  Mean of Arrival Delay for Satisfied Passengers is 12.5 minute 

* Mean of Arrival Delay for Dissatisfied or Neutral Passengers is 17 minute

* Mean of Departure Delay for Satisfied Passengers is 12.5 minute 

* Mean of Departure Delay for Dissatisfied or Neutral Passengers is 16 minute

* Most of Neutral or Dissatisfied  Passenger give inFlight wifi rating of Good(3) and Fair(2)

* Most of  Satisfied Passenger give inFlight wifi rating of Excellent(5) and Very Good(4)

* for Loyal Customers : Satisfied and  Neutral or Dissatisfied are close to each other

* for Disloyal Customers :  Neutral or Dissatisfied is much bigger than Satisfied

* Most of Neutral or Dissatisfied  Passenger give food and drink  rating of Good(3) and Fair(2)

* Most of  Satisfied Passenger give food and drink rating of Excellent(5) and Very Good(4)

* Satisfied Passengers have flight distance more than Dissatisfied or Neutral Passengers

* Most of Neutral or Dissatisfied  Passenger give seat  rating of Good(3) and Very Good(4)

* Most of  Satisfied Passenger give seat rating of Excellent(5) and Very Good(4)

* Build ML Model using Gradient Boost For Predicting the Customer Satisfication with accuracy 97% in Training and 96.5 in Testing
